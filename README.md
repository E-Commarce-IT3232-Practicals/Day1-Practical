### Practical 5: Create a Number Pattern with Array 🔠
This exercise generates a number pattern using an array. It asks the user for a number and creates a symmetric pattern based on the input.

### Practical 6: Calculate Average Marks of Students 🏫
In this practical, we create a `Student` class, add five student objects to a collection, and calculate the average marks.

### Practical 7: Library System (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation) 📚
This practical simulates a library system where we handle different types of books like printed books, e-books, and audiobooks using object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### Practical 8: Retail Store Management System 🏬
This program manages a retail store where you can store, edit, and delete products such as fruits, vegetables, and groceries. It uses inheritance to define different product types and encapsulation for managing product data.

## Key Concepts Covered 📘

- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for repetitive tasks.
- **Conditionals**: `if` and `else` statements to control program flow.
- **Arrays**: Storing and manipulating collections of data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: 
  - **Classes and Objects** 🏗️
  - **Inheritance**: Creating subclasses from a parent class 👨‍👩‍👦
  - **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and method overloading 🔄
  - **Encapsulation**: Using private fields and public methods to protect data 🔒
- **Data Structures**: Using `ArrayList` to store and manage data collections 📊
